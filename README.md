## Introduction

HTML5 is quickly becoming the standard in terms of front-end coding, and as a web developer you definitely need to know how to code HTML5 websites. After almost two years of HTML5 coding, I have compiled this list of my favorites "best practices" with the hope that it will be as useful to you as it is to me.

## Adaptation
These coding standards are adapted and inspired by Google, Mozilla, IBM, coding standards and modified as per organizational need and requirement.

## Contents
- HTML Coding Conventions
- CSS Coding Conventions

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Faisalaziz/UI-UX/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Faisalaziz/UI-UX/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
